Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC), [@EnergyFall266](https://github.com/EnergyFall266) and [@igorFNegrizoli](https://www.github.com/igorFNegrizoli) in 2021.

This project was an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence class we took in our 3rd year of Computer Science.

Developed in Python with PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy and Scikit Learn, it is an Artificial Intelligence that classifies stellar objects using the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucidlenn/sloan-digital-sky-survey) with an accuracy of 96.25%.
